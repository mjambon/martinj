<h2>About Me</h2>

<!-- (A short, direct introduction)
   - Who you are and why you create art.
   - A personal statement about your artistic vision or what drives you.
-->
<p>
  I'm a French Californian residing in the San Francisco Bay Area since
  2010. I make art that speaks to the mind in terms that are
  free of conventions, opening the doors to new spiritual experiences.
</p>

<h2>My Work</h2>

<!--
    A concise description of your artistic style, themes, and techniques.
    How you approach painting—what fascinates you, what you explore in --
  --your work.
-->

<p>
  My artworks are mostly two-dimensional pieces on canvas or wood panels.
  I employ a small number of solid colors and surfaces such as pure
  acrylic paints and metal leaf. These are arranged into compositions
  where shape and color work indissociably to produce a visual impact
  from a small number of elements.
</p>
<p>
  I am drawn toward the emergence of rich effects from simple and
  discrete elementary patterns similar to
  the color dots of pointillist paintings. Unlike pointillism, I
  don't combine brush strokes of the same shape and
  size, but hard-edged shapes of different sizes.
  By varying the viewing distance and the point of focus, a viewer
  navigating a painting will go through different impressions
  blending concrete objects and more abstract sentiments.
</p>

<h2>How I Got Here</h2>

<!--
    A brief, honest take on your journey into art.
    Acknowledgment that you started later in life but that creativity has always been there.
    A subtle nod to your background (without making it the focus).
-->

<p>
  At a late point in my life in 2021, personal circumstances took
  me to the realization that a meaningful form of art had clicked in my
  mind. I suddenly felt I had a duty to create these art pieces.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<!--
    Where your artistic practice is headed.
    What excites you about the work you’re currently doing.
-->
<p>
  Right now, my focus is purely on making art&mdash;exploring ideas,
  refining my technique, and developing a body of work that feels true
  to me.
