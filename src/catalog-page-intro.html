  All paintings have painted edges. They arrive ready to hang
  and don't need framing.
  We ship internationally.
  Shipping and any applicable taxes are not included in the prices displayed.

  If you'd like to exhibit a selection of my paintings for free
  in your public space in the San Francisco Bay Area, we can make
  it happen.
