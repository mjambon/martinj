ser-20230318,img-20230416,Color on Canvas,Couleur sur toile,mistyrose,25.00%,<p>This is an ongoing series of medium to large paintings using a solid-color background and hard-edge color shapes on canvas.</p>
ser-20230111,img-20230122,Color on Wood,Couleur sur bois,darkmagenta,40.00%,"<p>These are the first paintings using a solid color background. They’re executed on wood panels, which is an excellent surface for smaller paintings but offers practical challenges in larger sizes such as warping and difficult transportation.</p>"
ser-20230108,img-20230108-4,Humanity,L’humanité,mediumaquamarine,20.00%,"<p>This one-off mini series uses a simple, iterative technique to create color patterns using acrylic paint on wood panels.</p>"
ser-20221030,img-20221221,Atmospheric Formations,Formations atmosphériques,gold,50.00%,"<p>This series is an early experiment with colorful backgrounds, deviating from the plain white or black background used before it.</p>"
ser-20221125,img-20221125-21,Millet’s Countryside,La campagne de Millet,sienna,20.00%,"<p>This series was an exercise in extending realistic scenes with colors and shapes that reinforce or alter the original scenes. The original artist, Jean-François Millet, was a great source of inspiration for Vincent van Gogh who remade several of Millet’s paintings in his own style. Here, the choice of Millet was driven by the desire to start from paintings or photos with a clear realistic composition, in color, without blatant symbolism, as well as copyright-free.</p>"
ser-20220320,img-20220409,Monochromes,Monochromes,navajowhite,30.00%,<p>This minimalist series consists of shapes in a single solid color on a plain paper background.</p>
ser-20220305,img-20220803-1,Polychromes,Polychromes,salmon,25.00%,"<p>This series consists of multicolored solid shapes executed with acrylic markers on paper. It marks the move away from using paintbrushes and sponges, constraining the composition to using a small, fixed set of colors and hard edges with no overlaps. It originally started as a test of the idea that any effect can be produced by juxtaposing colors without a need to blend colors much like the work of pointillists. It was successful and ended up defining my main style.</p>"
ser-20220212,img-20220313,Multilayer,Couches multiples,palegreen,40.00%,"<p>This series was a brief foray into acrylic painting with paintbrushes, sponges, and other means, on canvas. Like later works, the composition was achieved incrementally. However, many layers of paint were allowed until a satisfying composition was obtained. This multi-layer approach was later abandoned in favor of marker-based techniques using hard edges and no overlapping regions.</p>"
ser-20220116,img-20220131,Full Space,Espace plein,tomato,55.00%,<p>These are the first paintings executed after feeling the urge to start painting in early 2022. I used acrylic paint and paintbrushes that we had been using for painting pebbles with my daughter. The support was paper because it’s all I had at the time and had never painted on canvas or wood panels before.</p>
